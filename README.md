# ‚òÅÔ∏è Liam's wasmCloud Playground üé°

## Introduction

This repo is for building Proof-of-Concept (PoC) [wasmCloud](https://wasmcloud.com/) applications. The goal is to deepen my understanding of wasmCloud, its internals, its strengths, its weaknesses, and how the [developer experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience#Developer_experience) (DX) is when building applications with it.

## Getting Started

1. Install the pre-requisites:
    - [just](https://github.com/casey/just)
    - Docker & Docker Compose
    - [wash](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/installation) (wasmCloud CLI)
1. Run `just up` to start the docker compose stack running to the wasmCloud components and dashboard UI, accessible at [localhost:3030](http://localhost:3030).
1. `cd` into the `hello` directory and run `wash build`. This builds the component in `../build` directory, which is mounted inside the wasmCloud container as specified in the Docker `compose.yaml` file.
1. Still in the `hello` directory, run `just deploy` (which runs `wash app deploy wadm.yaml` under the hood) to deploy the hello application. This includes a http capability provider and an actor listening on `localhost:8061`.
1. Run `curl localhost:8061` to see the actor's response.

## Troubleshooting

You may need to [install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) and the `wasi32-wasi` target, which can be installed by running `rustup target add wasm32-wasi` after installing Rust.
