# ‚òÅÔ∏è Liam's wasmCloud Playground üé°

## Introduction

This repo is for building Proof-of-Concept (PoC) [wasmCloud](https://wasmcloud.com/) applications. The goal is to deepen my understanding of wasmCloud, its internals, its strengths, its weaknesses, and how the [developer experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience#Developer_experience) (DX) is when building applications with it.

## Getting Started

The below steps will guide you through setting up the wasmCloud stack and deploying both a Rust and Go Actors & capability providers. Finally we will explore integrating both actors, and integrating an access control solution.

### Pre-requisites

1. Install the pre-requisites:
    - [just](https://github.com/casey/just)
    - Docker & Docker Compose
    - [wash](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/installation) (wasmCloud CLI)
    - [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
    - Go & [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/getting-started/install/) if wanting to compile a Go component.

### Running the wasmCloud Stack

1. Run `just up` to start the docker compose stack running to the wasmCloud components and dashboard UI, accessible at [localhost:3030](http://localhost:3030).

### Deploy a Rust App (Actor and Provider)

1. `cd` into the `hello-rust` directory and run `wash build`. This builds the component in `../build` directory, which is mounted inside the wasmCloud container as specified in the Docker `compose.yaml` file.
1. Still in the `hello-rust` directory, run `just deploy` (which runs `wash app deploy wadm.yaml` under the hood) to deploy the hello application. This includes a http capability provider and an actor listening on [localhost:8061](http://localhost:8061).
1. Run `curl localhost:8061` to see the actor's response.

#### Rust App Troubleshooting

- You may need to [install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
- You may need to add the `wasi32-wasi` target.
  - It is installed by running `rustup target add wasm32-wasi`

### Deploy a Go App (Actor and Provider)

1. `cd` into the `hello-go` directory and run `wash build`. This builds the component in `../build` directory, which is mounted inside the wasmCloud container as specified in the Docker `compose.yaml` file.
1. Still in the `hello-go` directory, run `just deploy` (which runs `wash app deploy wadm.yaml` under the hood) to deploy the hello application. This includes a http capability provider and an actor listening on [localhost:8062](http://localhost:8062).
1. Run `curl localhost:8062` to see the actor's response.

#### Go App Troubleshooting

- You may need to [install TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/getting-started/install/).

### TODO: Deploy a Policy Actor

TODO.

#### Policy Actor Troubleshooting

- You may need to add the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target. This is required for the `policy` actor.
  - Install it by running `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`

### TODO: OpenFGA (Access Control Solution) Setup

By default (running `just up`), OpenFGA components will be provisioned. Use `just up-no-openfga` to run only wasmCloud components (no OpenFGA components) using Docker Compose.

The OpenFGA playground will be available at [localhost:3000/playground](http://localhost:3000/playground).

### Miscellaneous Tips

- You can use `wash spy {actor_id}` to see the interactions of an actor. As of 26-03-2024, you must enable `WASH_EXPERIMENTAL` to use this feature. Example output:

    ```sh
    ‚ùØ WASH_EXPERIMENTAL=true wash spy MAGFAN3NPIDLH3W63R3BMXIEAQATMRVZ4L3BI6DNYA324ZKO4CUHCXR6
    Spying on actor MAGFAN3NPIDLH3W63R3BMXIEAQATMRVZ4L3BI6DNYA324ZKO4CUHCXR6
